            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>

            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
            </ul>

            <header>What you should already know</header>
            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>
            </ul>

        <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>

            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>

            <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

        <section id="Declaring_variables" class="main-section">
            <header>Declaring variables</header>

            <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
            <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
            <code><pre>var x = 42.</pre></code>

            <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
            <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>

            <code><pre>x = 42.</pre></code>
            <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
            <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>

            <code><pre>let y = 13.</pre></code>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="Variable_scope" class="main-section">
            <header>Variable scope</header>

            <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>

            <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>

            <code><pre>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</pre></code>

            <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>

            <code><pre>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); 
// ReferenceError: y is not defined</pre></code>
        </section>

        <section id="Global_variables" class="main-section">
            <header>Global variables</header>

            <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>

            <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="Constants" class="main-section">
            <header>Constants</header>

            <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
            <code><pre>const PI = 3.14;</pre></code>

            <p>A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.

            The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.
                
            You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:</p>

            <code><pre>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; 
const f = 5; 
// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() 
{ const g = 5; var g; //statements}
            </pre></code>

            <p>However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement is executed without problems.</p>

            <code><pre>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; 
MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</pre></code>
